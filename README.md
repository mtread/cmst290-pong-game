# JavaScript Pong Game 🎮

This is a simple browser-based Pong game recreated using HTML5 and JavaScript. It was built as part of a project for my CMST 290 course, where we explored interactive media and web-based communication tools.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to control your paddle on the left side.
- The right paddle is controlled by a basic AI opponent.
- The ball bounces off the paddles and walls — if you miss it, the other side scores.
- The game automatically resets the ball when someone scores.

## 💡 Features

- Real-time player control using keyboard input
- Simple computer-controlled AI opponent
- Ball physics with bounce, reflection angles, and collision detection
- Built using HTML5 Canvas for all graphics (no external libraries)

## 📚 Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas** – for drawing the game screen
- **JavaScript** – for game logic and interactivity
- **GitHub Pages** – for hosting the live version of the game

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure JavaScript for game design (objects, animation loops)
- Basics of collision detection and real-time input handling
- The role of interactivity in digital communication and media
